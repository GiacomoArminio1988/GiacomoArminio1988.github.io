Quick hummus recipe

This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I
have read over the years.

Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled
meats and pitta breads.

For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.

<strong>Storage</strong>

Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made
it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
